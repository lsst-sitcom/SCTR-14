Source & A single detection of an astrophysical object in an image, the characteristics for which are stored in the Source Catalog of the DRP database. The association of Sources that are non-moving lead to Objects; the association of moving Sources leads to Solar System Objects. (Note that in non-LSST usage "source" is often used for what LSST calls an Object.) \\\hline
